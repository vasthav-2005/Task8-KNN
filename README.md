1. Firstly we import necessary libraries
2. Then we import the dataset
3. Then we select the features based on which to be clustered. And then scale the feature.
4. Using elbow method we find the ideal number of cluster.
5. Then we initialize the model and fit and predict the data into the model.
6. Then using Silhoutte score estimate our prediction
